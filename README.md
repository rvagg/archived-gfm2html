**Turn Markdown files into HTML**

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/gfm2html.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/gfm2html/)

Also includes inline CSS, styled so that the page renders nearly identically to Markdown on GitHub, including syntax-highlighting.

Install with `npm install gfm2html -g` (you may need to `sudo` that), then you have a `gfm2html` command ready to use that will take an input file and an output file.
